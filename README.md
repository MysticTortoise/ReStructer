# ReStructer - Lightweight Serialization
ReStructer is a lightweight serialization library/toolkit made primarily for
[TeaPacket](https://github.com/MysticTortoise/TeaPacketModular).

It is still in early development so don't expect much here.

Info about how to use the library is in `docs`.

The library for reading is available in `reading`. It also comes with a small test program.

Python scripts for generating struct reading functions will be available in `generators`.
